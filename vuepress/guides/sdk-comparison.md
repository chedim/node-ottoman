# Ottoman Vs SDK Comparison

This document outlines subtle differences between Ottoman and Node.js SDK
and also demonstrate the value proposition (advantages) that Ottoman brings over Node.js SDK.

## Value Proposition

Data Integrity:
Defining structure to data, validating data and enforcing constraints using lightweight code patterns.

Cost:  
Open Source, secure, fully supported, less maintenance overhead, less infrastructure cost, extensible and can work with any Javascript or Typescript native application.

Agile Development:
Be a leader in your space, build and deliver applications quickly and timely. Spend your time solving business problems rather than coding.

Adaptability:
Minimal learning curve, resource with skill set available in abundance.
